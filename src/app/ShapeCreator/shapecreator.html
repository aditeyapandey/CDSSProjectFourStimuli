        <p><b>Informed Consent to Participate in a Research Study</b>
          We are inviting you to take part in a research study. This form will tell you about the study, but the researcher will explain it to you first. You may ask this person any questions that you have. When you are ready to make a decision, you may tell the researcher if you want to participate or not. You do not have to participate if you do not want to. If you decide to participate, the researcher will ask you to sign this statement and will give you a copy to keep.
        </p>
        <p><b>Why am I being asked to take part in this research study?</b>
          You are being recruited to provide data for a study of visual perception.
        </p>
        <p><b>Why is this research study being done?</b>
          The purpose of this research is to improve our understanding of visual perception.
        </p>
        <p><b>What will I be asked to do?</b>
          If you decide to take part in this study, we will ask you to view static or moving images on a computer screen and to make judgments about them. For example, you may be asked to identify a letter, to read a word or sentence, to recognize a face or to report the direction of a moving target. In some cases your eyes may be tracked with an eye tracker or you may wear 3D glasses.
        </p>
        <p><b>Where will this take place and how much of my time will it take?</b>
          This research will take place in the Translational Vision Laboratory in the Psychology Department of Northeastern University and online via Amazon Mechanical Turk. It will last approximately 15 minutes.
        </p>
        <p><b>Will there be any risk or discomfort to me?</b>
          The experiment presents no more risk or discomfort that routine use of a computer
          or television.
        </p>
        <p><b>Will I benefit by being in this research?</b>
          There will be no direct benefit to you for taking part in the study, however, the information learned from this study may help ongoing studies in the Translational Vision Laboratory that aim to develop new therapies and assessment methods for visual impairment.
        </p>
        <p><b>Who will see the information about me?</b>
          Your part in this study will be confidential. Only the researchers on this study will see the information about you. No reports or publications will use information that can identify you in any way or any individual as being of this project.All participants are assigned a random identification code that cannot be traced back to your identity and all data are stored in password-protected computers in locked offices.
        </p>
        <p><b>What will happen if I suffer any harm from this research?</b>
          No special arrangements will be made for compensation or for payment for treatment solely because of my participation in this research.
        </p>
        <p><b>Can I stop my participation in this study?</b>
          Your participation in this research is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you do not want to and you can refuse to answer any question. Even if you begin the study, you may quit at any time. If you do not participate or if you decide to quit, you will not lose any rights, benefits, or services that you would otherwise have as a student.
